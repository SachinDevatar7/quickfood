# QuickFood

*Have you ever forgot to put in an ingredient in your dish or the recipe itself? As a student, it was hectic for me to manage cooking and keep track of all the recipes. So I built 'QuickFood'. I cooked up (pun intended) a web app where I can do a quick lookup for a dish and get its recipe and calories. It is built with React for the frontend and Nodejs express for the backend.*

## API Usage

*Edamam has available for content licensing over 40,000 recipes from top recipe publishers. Each recipe comes with image, title, ingredient list labels.*
